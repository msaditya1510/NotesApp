# NotesApp

## Description
This is a simple web-based **Markdown Notes App** that enables users to write, save, and export their notes in `.txt` format.

## Learning and Development Process
I have experience in **Java** and am currently working towards becoming a **Java Developer**. However, Iâ€™m still a **beginner in JavaScript**. To complete this project, I sought guidance from ChatGPT, as my JavaScript knowledge was limited. I was able to handle the **HTML** and **CSS** components on my own. Throughout the development process, I gained a better understanding of JavaScript basics.
